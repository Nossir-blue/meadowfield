# MEADOWFIELD
This Project is a simple automaton, a little program that
performs a task in a virtual world. The automaton will be a mail-delivery robot
picking up and dropping off parcels

## Why am i doing this?
I am reading a book and i want to test myself on what i've learned so far
i could just go to Spring Boot if i wanted but you know, NodeJS's the standard
Javascript is kind of convoluted but i am understanding the more i keep consistent
at it

## How to run this?
Just npm start
npm test does nothing because i know jackshit about testing

## Can i implement features?
Bruh, do whatever you want, this is just a consolidation test, not the next chatGPT
